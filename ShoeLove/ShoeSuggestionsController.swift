// *** From documentation : Request authorization at the point where you need location services. For example, wait until the user activates a feature of your app that requires location data. Don't request authorization at launch time unless you need the user's location immediately or your app was launched in the background by the system to handle a location update.***

    //**IMPORTANT ASKING USER FOR LOCATION PERMISSION** It is recommended that you request only when-in-use authorization whenever possible. If your app requests and receives when-in-use authorization, you can make a separate request for always authorization later.
    
    // **IMPORTANT TODO: PICKING SERVICE TYPE TO FETCH USER LOCATION** - To help save power, disable location services (or switch to a lower-power alternative) when you do not need the location data offered by the service. For example, you might disable location services when your app is in the background and would not use that data otherwise.
