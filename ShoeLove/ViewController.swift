    // **IMPORTANT TODO: PICKING SERVICE TYPE TO FETCH USER LOCATION** - To help save power, disable location services (or switch to a lower-power alternative) when you do not need the location data offered by the service. For example, you might disable location services when your app is in the background and would not use that data otherwise.
